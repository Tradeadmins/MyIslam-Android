                    Muhammad (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him), son of Abdullah, was born in Makkah around the year 570 CE. He became known by his people as Al-Amin (the trustworthy one).
                </p></br>
                <p> When Muhammad reached the age of forty, the angel Gabriel came to him bringing revelation. At first, Muhammad was instructed to invite only his immediate family, including his wife Khadijah, to Islam; eventually, it was revealed to him that he should deliver Allah's message to <u>all humankind.</u> For the rest of his life, he communicated this message to others, set <u>an excellent example</u>, and was a perfect role model for humanity. In the year 632, Prophet Muhammad died at the age of sixty-three.</p></br>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad (may God's blessings and peace be upon him) is called "the Seal of the Prophets." As the final prophet, he was sent to confirm all the truth that had been revealed before him, including the original Gospel of Jesus (which is different from today's Gospels).</p></br>
                <p>The Glorious Qur'an testifies that <b>{Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets.} (33:40)</b></p></br>
                <p>Confirming the link between Jesus and him, Prophet Muhammad promised, "If a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me, he will get a double reward." He also stated, "I am the nearest of all the people to Jesus, the son of Mary, for there was no prophet between him and me."</p></br>
                <p>These Prophetic sayings show us how Muhammad honoured Jesus (may God's blessings and peace be upon them both). Later, I will discuss a prophecy that Jesus made in the Bible about the coming of Muhammad. </p></br>
                <b>PROPHET MUHAMMAD'S DISTINGUISHED PERSONALITY</b>
                <p>
                    Muhammad-from the time of his childhood and youth, through the years of his prophethood, and up until his death- has been recognized by fair-minded people throughout history as a special and noble personality with a unique character and morals. He was merciful, honest, sincere, kind, and humble. Every detail of not only his public utterances but also his private life has been authentically documented and faithfully preserved up to the present day.
                    He was a prophet, a messenger, a religious teacher, a social reformer, a moral guide, a leader, a statesman, a faithful friend, a wonderful companion, a devoted husband, and a loving father.

                    In his wonderful book Muhammad in the Bible, Professor Abdul-Ahad Dawud (formerly the Reverend David Benjamin) notes that the Bible foretells the advent of a prophet who is 'like unto' Moses:

                    We read the following words in the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 18, verse 18: "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth." If these words do not apply to Muhammad, they still remain unfulfilled. Jesus himself never claimed to be the Prophet alluded to... Jesus, as is believed by his Church, will appear as a Judge and not as a law-giver; but the promised one has to come with a "fiery law" in "his right hand" [Deut. 33:2].

                    Muslim scholars assert that this prophecy applies to none other than Muhammad because Moses and Muhammad are alike in many ways. Their names begin with the same letter; they are alike in their normal births, marriages, missions, and normal deaths; both were prophets, rulers, leaders, and statesmen; and both brought a "fiery law." On the other hand, Jesus is unlike Moses in his birth, mission, and end; Jesus did not get married, nor did he rule his people or fight wars as Moses did.

                    -I became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission.

                    Muhammad was among those great religious figures, prophets and founders of religions, whose remarkable character and personality inspired uncommon confidence and commitment. His phenomenal success in attracting followers and creating a community-state that dominated Arabia could be attributed not only to the fact that he was a shrewd military strategist but also to the fact that he was an unusual man… Muhammad's followers found him righteous, trustworthy, pious, honest and compassionate.

                    The stories and evidence of the Prophet's magnificent personal attributes are too numerous to mention here, so let us take just one example.
                    After his Makkan opponents rejected him and his message of Islam...
                    After they persecuted and mistreated him, trying to kill him many times...
                    After they tortured and killed many of his followers and loved ones...
                    After they fought him and his companions, driving them out of their homes and seizing their properties and land…
                </p></br>

                <p>
                    How did Muhammad treat these enemies when he entered Makkah and liberated it from idolatry and paganism?

                <p>
                    In the wake of this momentous victory for Muhammad and the Muslims, at the climax of their joy, rapture, and happiness at coming back home to the sacred city of Makkah… Prophet Muhammad gathered together the Makkans, who were afraid that he would harm or even kill them in revenge for their past abuse and killing of Muslims.

                    Muhammad asked them, <b>"What do you think I am going to do with you?"</b>
                    They answered, "You are a generous brother and the son of an honourable brother of ours."<br />
                    Then the kind, tolerant, generous, and merciful Prophet forgave them. He announced, <b>"No harm will come to you. You may go. You are free."</b>
                    Have you ever seen such a scene? Have you ever heard such a story? Can you sense the Prophet's mercy?

                    Describing this unprecedented historic event, Professor John Esposito stated:

                    Eschewing vengeance and the plunder of conquest, the Prophet instead accepted a settlement, granting amnesty rather than wielding the sword toward his former enemies. For their part, the Meccans converted to Islam, accepted Muhammad's leadership, and were incorporated within the umma (Muslim community).

                    In contrast, are you aware of the atrocities committed by various 'superpower' nations throughout human history, when they unjustly attacked, invaded, and tortured others?

                    Remarkably, the more we discover about Muhammad's life, the more we come to realize his excellent conduct and character, and that he was indeed <b>{sent as a mercy to the worlds.} (Qur'an 21:107)</b>

                    Prophet Muhammad said, "I have been sent to perfect the noble traits of character."

                    Confirming this fact, Allah tells him in the Glorious Qur'an, <b>{Indeed, you are of a great moral character.} (68:4)</b>
